<h1>!---- Guess My Number ----!</h1>
<p>The "Guess My Number" game is an interactive web application designed to entertain and challenge users by testing their guessing skills. The objective is simple: guess the correct number within a predefined range to win the game. Upon loading the game, users are presented with a user-friendly interface that includes input fields to enter their guesses, a button to submit their guess, and feedback messages to guide them towards the correct answer.

Behind the scenes, the game utilizes HTML for structuring the layout and user interface elements, CSS for styling and enhancing the visual appeal, and JavaScript for implementing the game logic and interactivity. JavaScript is particularly instrumental in generating a random number for the user to guess, comparing the user's input with the correct answer, providing feedback based on the correctness of the guess, and keeping track of the number of attempts made by the user.

The game employs event listeners to detect user interactions such as submitting a guess and dynamically updating the interface to reflect the current state of the game. Additionally, it incorporates conditional statements and loops to control the flow of the game and ensure a smooth and engaging user experience.</p>
